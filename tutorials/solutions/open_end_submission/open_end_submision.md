# Open Ended submission

Our open end submission consists of two new additions to the devi codebase. (Link to the fork: [https://github.com/pedro2mj/qats](https://github.com/pedro2mj/qats))

## Quantum circuit representation in VQE class

We noticed that the library is missing an option to easily represent the quantum circuits generated by the VQE algorithm. This is relevant in the process of designing and testing VQE algorithm, especially when they are run in a real quantum computer, where the number of gates is very relevant for the feasiblity of the circuit.

We created a class called VQEPlotCircuitExtension ( \qprog\algorithms\\_vqe_extension.py) that has circuits as an atribute of the class and a method to plot them.

An example of usage of this plot function can be found in tutorials\solutions\challenge_2\print_circs_example.py

## Sweeping over different number of layers on VQEHyperparameterSweep

Another thing that we noticed is that the VQEHyperparameterSweep does not sweep over the different numbers of layers so we also implemented this functionality in the class VQEHyperparameterSweepExtension ( \qprog\workflows\\_vqe_seweep_extension.py).

An example of usage of this function can be found in tutorials\solutions\challenge_2\print_circs_example.py
